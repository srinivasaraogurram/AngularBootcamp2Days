Angular 16 Forms – Routing with Services Two Day Boot Camp
Short Overview
Angular is a JavaScript framework designed and developed to support front-end applications, browser-based applications. Angular ships with a boilerplate app already built in. It is secure, robust, and reliable. Angular is open-source. It was developed by Alphabet for creating dynamic modern web apps and SPAs. Angular uses TypeScript for the supporting code and regular HTML for the front end. Development is based on Components.

In this boot camp we focus on routing. Although Angular does not produce physical files that can be stored on a computer, it produces views. Several views can be combined into a layout or application interface. Routing therefore allow users to switch between views, pass values into views and restrict views based on some logic. Routing also supports lazy loading.

Audience
Newer JavaScript programmers  with at least 2 years working experience. This boot camp is only for JavaScript programmers or those working with the language regularly. Any JavaScript programmer with more than 2 years’ experience but have never worked with Angular will also benefit.

 

Objectives:
After completing this course participants will be able to:

Create a boilerplate Angular application
Add components to an existing application
Create views and display components.
Pass parameters (values) to components
Generate child routes
Restrain certain components from being loaded until needed
Use middleware to support lazy loaded components
